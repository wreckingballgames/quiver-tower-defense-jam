# Quiver Tower Defense Game Jam 2023

My work for Quiver's tower defense game jam, based on their Outpost Assault code template. I plan to use this project to further my Godot skills, sharpen up my Git habits, and to put into practice what I'm learning from the book _A Playful Production Proceess_ by Richard Lemarchand.
