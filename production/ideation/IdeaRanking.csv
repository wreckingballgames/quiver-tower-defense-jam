Ideas,
Defending a farm in a dystopian setting,
Custom mouse cursors,
"Flamethrower tower which spews flame in a long, narrow cone",
Toxic sprayer tower that attacks in a cone and inflicts damage over time effect,
"Scarecrows, placeable anywhere, which attract enemies then explode",
Placeable hazards which slow or damage enemies over time,
Placeable squads of NPC allies; ability to assume control of an ally and walk around and shoot as part of gameplay,
Allied troops as resource earned at certain times rather than something bought with money,
Input to switch between buy mode and ally placement mode (and playable unit mode if implemented),
Functionality to order friendly NPCs to a given location or toggle certain behavior (see tower slot code for a base),
Placeable traps in general,
Placeable cage trap which holds a group of enemies in one place for a duration after being triggered,
Enemy engineer unit which builds enemy towers in unused tower slots,
"More UI information, such as wave countdown, enemy total and enemies remaining, indicators pointing to off-screen enemies",
"Enemy AI which weighs routes on the map to avoid more heavily-guarded areas first, with traps and friendlies weighted uniquely",
"Carrier aircraft enemy type which spawns groups of enemies closer to the objective, skipping over friendly towers",
Flechette towers that shoot loose groups of physical objects,
Pieces of a giant robot scattered on the map which allied troops can bring back to objective for a super unit,
Enemy sapper unit which inflicts damage over time on friendly towers before disappearing,
Robber enemies that rush the objective to sap money instead of health,
Innocent NPCs to protect as bonus objectives for ranking or money,
"Special powers which cost money to deploy, like airstrike or freeze blast",
Farming mini-game with farm slots which must be tended to earn money and replaced at a cost when destroyed or exhausted,
Second underground map connecting points on the map with tunnels; useable by enemies after a certain number of waves,
See underground map; ability to detonate certain tunnels in the underground map shut with limited resource,
Mobile objective which moves on command or after certain triggers,
Stealthy enemies that are impossible to target for a duration after spawning and/or every once in a while,
"Fast enemies which pick a tower and run circles around it, confusing the turret, before disappearing",
Switches that toggle enemy routes like a train track,
Experience system with Survivors-like loot and upgrades,
Enemies attack allies  instead of objective while they are performing objectives like carrying robot pieces,
Civil War-themed uniforms for allies,
Decoy towers that attract enemies instead of the objective for a duration but which are very expensive,
Tower which jabs a spear through whatever enemies are in a line after the first one targeted,
A third faction of enemies which attacks your objective as well as your enemies,
New art style,
