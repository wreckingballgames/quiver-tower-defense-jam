# Project Time Table

Very rough estimates to keep myself on track for this project. I am trying to follow the model of *A Playful Production Process* by Richard Lemarchand, which I am reading side by side with my work on this project.

- Week 1 - Dec-15 thru Dec-22: Ideation ~~(including prototyping)~~
- Week 2 - Dec-22 thru Dec-29: Prototyping
- Week 3 - Dec-29 thru Jan-05: 
- Week 4 - Jan-05 thru Jan-12:
